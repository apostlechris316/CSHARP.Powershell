# INSTRUCTIONS: Getting Started With Powershell 
# DESCRIPTION:  This quickstart is meant to get you started quickly when building Powershell Scripts.
#		It will NOT necessarily provide the most optimized scripts, but will help you rapidly develop scripts to get things done.
#		
#		What you get:
#
#		- A sample base script that you can use to fill in your specifics.
#		- A library of sample script calls to perform given tasks.
#		- A script assistant that can be used to build a script based on the sample base and sample calls. (COMING SOON)
#	
# PRE-REQUISITES: Before running this script ensure:
#
#     - We recommend placing the _rwc folder in the root of c:\ if you move it then edit the Settings.xml and replace c:\_rwc with the location you are storing the folder.

Install Instructions
--------------------

1) Copy the contents of this folder to the place you want your script to live. From now on we will call this the "Powershell Root Folder"

2) Edit the settings.xml file so the AssemblyFilePath matches where you will store any custom binaries. We will call this the "Powershell Custom Binaries Folder"

3) Rename "Sample Base Script.ps1" to match your script name. We will refer to this script as "your main Powershell Script".

4) Edit your main Powershell Script, changing the name and description.
 
5) Open a command prompt using Run As Administrator.
   Ensure the command prompt is pointing at the Powershell Root folder.
   You can run someting like this to change directory.

	cd C:\_rwc

6) Run the command below but change MyScript to you script name:

	PowerShell.exe -Command "& {Start-Process PowerShell.exe -ArgumentList '-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ""%MyScript.ps1""' -Verb RunAs}"

7) Look in the task_templates folder for tasks to add to your script. Task templates are stored in files with extension of .ps1t
   There is a corresponding file with extension .HELP that you can open in Notepad to get more information on the task and how to use it.
   Each task template has 3 sections: 

	1) The comment block which exists between the #----- and #---- this section provides developer notes regarding the task.
	2) The settings block which exists between #------ and #~~~~ this section provides settings for automated applications such as PowerScriptBuilder.
           It will show all the token names but may contain other default settings as well.
	3) The code block which is everything after the #~~~~~~
